I’m a 3rd-year Aerospace Engineering student with a fire for flying machines and a deep obsession with control systems. From **swarm drones** to **hydrofoils**, I design and build vehicles that think fast, fly smooth, and move smart.

With hands-on experience in **UAV dynamics**, **Simulink-based control**, and **embedded systems**, I bridge the gap between code and craft—crafting systems that don’t just work, but perform. Whether it’s prototyping with STM32 boards or simulating multi-agent flight behaviors, I dive deep and deliver.

I believe engineering isn’t just about solving problems—it's about reimagining what's possible.

Let’s build the future. 🛸
